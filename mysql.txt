Data Cleaning and Analysis
After importing the data into MySQL, I have further cleaned and transformed it using Tableau for enhanced analysis. Below are the SQL queries used to explore and analyze the data:

sql
Copy code
SELECT count(*) FROM customers;

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE market_code='Mark001';

WHERE date.year=2020;
Combines transactions with the date table to show records for the year 2020.

Show total revenue for the year 2020:

Copy code
SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount) FROM transactions
INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date=date.date
WHERE date.year=2020 AND (transactions.currency='INR' OR transactions.currency='USD');
Calculates the total revenue for 2020, including both INR and USD currencies.

Show total revenue for January 2020:

Show total revenue for the year 2020 in Chennai:
