1. Database Import
To start the project, I imported the raw data into MySQL:

Download the SQL database dump from the db_dump.sql file.
Import the db_dump.sql file into your local MySQL server.
2. Data Cleaning and Preparation in MySQL
After importing the data, I executed the following SQL queries to clean and analyze it:

Show all customer records:

SELECT * FROM customers;
Show total number of customers:


SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;
Show transactions for the Chennai market (market code 'Mark001'):


SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE market_code='Mark001';
Show distinct product codes sold in Chennai:

SELECT DISTINCT product_code FROM transactions WHERE market_code='Mark001';
Show transactions where currency is US dollars:

SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE currency='USD';
Show transactions for the year 2020 (joined with the date table):

SELECT transactions.*, date.* FROM transactions
INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date=date.date
WHERE date.year=2020;
Show total revenue for the year 2020:

SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount) FROM transactions
INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date=date.date
WHERE date.year=2020 AND (transactions.currency='INR' OR transactions.currency='USD');
Show total revenue for January 2020:

SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount) FROM transactions
INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date=date.date
WHERE date.year=2020 AND date.month_name='January'
AND (transactions.currency='INR' OR transactions.currency='USD');
Show total revenue for Chennai in 2020:

SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount) FROM transactions
INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date=date.date
WHERE date.year=2020 AND transactions.market_code='Mark001';

Data Import and Preparation in Tableau:

Imported the cleaned data from MySQL into Tableau.

Created the following calculated fields to enhance data analysis:

Normalized Amount:

plaintext
Copy code
IF [Currency] = 'USD' THEN [Sales Amount] * 83 ELSE [Sales Amount] END
Converts sales amounts from USD to INR using a conversion rate of 83, if the currency is USD.

Profit Margin:

plaintext
Copy code
SUM([Profit]) / SUM([Sales Amount])

Calculates the profit margin by dividing the total profit by the total sales amount.
